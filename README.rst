cookiecutter-simple-django
==========================

A cookiecutter_ template for Django.

.. _cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter

Description
-----------

Lighter version of the Daniel Greenfeld's cookiecutter-django.

It uses the latest stable versions and it only defines a skeleton which can be extended as needed.

Usage
------

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

First, get cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::

Set up your virtualenv::

    $ cd <your-envs-folder>
    $ virtualenv  --no-site-packages redditclone
    $ cd redditclone
    $ source bin/activate
    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cd <your-workspace>
    $ cookiecutter  https://github.com/marcofucci/cookiecutter-simple-django.git

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a Django project for you.


**Warning**: After this point, change 'Marco Fucci', etc to your own information.

It prompts you for questions. Answer them::

    project_name (default is "project_name")? redditclone
    repo_name (default is "repo_name")? redditclone
    author_name (default is "Your Name")? Marco Fucci
    email (default is "Your email")? <your-email>
    description (default is "A short description of the project.")? A reddit clone
    year (default is "Current year")? 2013
    with_documentation (default is "yes")? yes

If you are using cookiecutter < 0.7 and you answered *no* to *with_documentation*, you might want to delete the ``docs`` 
folder. 
From version 0.7+, that folder is automatically deleted for you.


Create the database ``redditclone`` and then set up your project::

    $ cd redditclone/
    $ ls
    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt
    $ python ./manage.py syncdb
    $ python ./manage.py migrate
    $ python ./manage.py runserver

and load localhost:8000/admin


Create a GitHub repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit!"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:marcofucci/redditclone.git
    $ git push -u origin master

**Note**: The ``requirements`` files don't define any package versions because it makes
more sense for you to use the latest ones when you set up your
project. After that point though, you really want to take note of the specific
versions installed so that they are not going to get updated without you knowing it.

In order to do this, just activate your virtual environment, pip freeze it and
update your requirements files::

    $ activate <your-envs-folder>/redditclone/bin/activate
    $ pip freeze
    $ # now open requirements/* and note down the versions used.


Structure
---------

The structure used should look quite familiar:

**Requirements**

The ``requirements`` folder contains a requirements file for each environment.

If you need to add a dependency please choose the right file.

**Settings**

The ``settings`` folder contains a settings file for each environment and the ``local`` settings should be gitignored.

If you take a look at ``base.py``, you'll see that it includes the optional module ``local.py``
in the same folder. There you can override the local values and gitignore will
exclude it from your commits.

The ``testing.py`` module is loaded automatically after ``base.py`` and ``local.py`` every time you
run ``python ./manage.py test``.

**Apps**

The ``apps`` folder should contain all your local django apps, this is to keep
the structure of the project clean.

When it's time to ``python ./manage.py startapp <name>``, just move the generated
module to ``apps``. If you want to know why this works, just take a look at the line::

    sys.path.insert(0, root('apps'))

in ``settings/base.py``.


Done!

Now, it's time to write the code!!!

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this to create your own version.
Once you have your fork working, let me know and I'll add it to a '*Similar Cookiecutter Templates*' list here.
It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork.

If you do rename your fork, I encourage you to submit it to the following places:

* cookiecutter_ so it gets listed in the README as a template.

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if they make my own project development
experience better.
